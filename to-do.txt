If you have some time and want to contribute, here are some things needed by cl-typesetting.
This list is not exhaustive

-User friendly syntaxes above the core syntax layer. (TeX syntax emulation,
 markup languages, alternative languages like Scribble, etc...)

-Completing the tables. (more options for the cells, cell styles, etc.)

-Completing the math mode and adding standard math-syntaxes (TeX, mathML)

-Adding commands for things like lists, choosing the hyphenation language, etc.

-Improving the styles handling (paragraph, titles styles etc.)

-Adding higher level processing functions like tables of content, indexes,
 sections/subsections numbering, etc.

-Completing and improving the core typesetting engine. (multi-lines
 hyphenation, rivers, grid-mode, etc.)

-Native integration and improvement of the cl-pdf charts (pie, histogram, lines, etc.)

-Making a stand alone executable so that non-lispers can use it.

-Making a typesetting server (webservice ?) so that non-lispers can use it.

-etc.

If you are interested by this or if you have other ideas, send them to me.
